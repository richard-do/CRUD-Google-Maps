Since mongodb doesn't inheritently has some auto increment function
we need to implement it outselves to track the IDs of the map, user,
and groups.

Problem 1: Heavy to constantly count the number of entries if it scales up
Possible solution: Store ID pairing with the user?

Problem 2: Similar issue, counting + constantly checking multiple tables
Possible solution: Store the id itself and increment every time its used

Problem 3: What to do when certain groups or maps become unowned?  AKA loses all owners or users
Possible solution: Set an attribute that the owned/unowned status and clean up after it does
            then store the freed up variables in a array to be used prior incrementing function

- Just for the sake of the project we're going to assume that a small number of users
will "use" it.  Otherwise we could attempt to modify the ID to account for larger values.

- Store the markers directly in the Maps entry
