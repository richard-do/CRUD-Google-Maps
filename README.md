# CRUD_MERN_GoogleMaps

Using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M as a guide to generate a CRUD application using MERN that utilizes google maps

Idea is to generate maps that has markers where groups of people can collaborate regarding events that occur.

Some resources:
stack overflow - https://stackoverflow.com
mongodb docs - docs.mongodb.com

REQUIRED

Replace the API_KEY with your API key from google cloud services for the frontend page.

Setup a MongoDB atlas account and setup a .env in the backend folder for the server setup.

It should look like
ATLAS_URI=<INSERT API HERE>
